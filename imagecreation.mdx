## Image Creation Models

### Harnessing AI for Visual Creativity

This feature allows users to transform ideas into visual representations, leveraging the power of advanced AI algorithms. Whether it's for generating unique artworks, visualizing concepts, or creating digital content, OpenRouter's Image Creation tool offers a versatile platform for a myriad of creative endeavors.

### The Mechanism of Image Generation

**Transforming Text into Images**

At the heart of OpenRouter's Image Creation feature is the ability to interpret textual descriptions and convert them into vivid, detailed images. This process involves:

- Understanding the textual description: The AI analyzes the input text to grasp the intended visual elements and style.
- Image synthesis: Utilizing deep learning techniques, the AI then synthesizes an image that aligns with the provided description.

**Customization and Control**

Users have significant control over the outcome, with the ability to specify details like:

- Subject matter: From landscapes to abstract concepts.
- Artistic style: Mimicking various art styles or creating something entirely new.
- Composition: Dictating the layout and interaction of elements within the image.

## Applications of Image Creation

OpenRouter's Image Creation tool opens up new possibilities across various fields:

- Graphic Design and Marketing: Creating visual content for campaigns, social media, and branding.
- Education and Research: Visualizing complex concepts for better understanding.
- Entertainment and Gaming: Generating assets and backgrounds for games and virtual environments.
- Art and Creative Expression: Assisting artists in bringing their visions to life.

## Building with Image Models (Beta)

## Step 1: Install Fetch API

Ensure that you have the Fetch API available in your environment. If you're using a modern browser or a Node.js version that supports it, you're all set. Otherwise, you may need to install a polyfill or use an alternative method for making HTTP requests.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Request

You'll be making a POST request to the OpenRouter API. Here's the basic structure you'll use, wrapped in a function for easy reuse:

```typescript Use Model On OpenRouter
  
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/objects/generations', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        "Authorization": \`Bearer \${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}\`,
        "HTTP-Referer": \`${YOUR_SITE_URL}\`, // Optional, for openrouter.ai rankings.
        "X-Title": \`${YOUR_SITE_NAME}\`, // Optional, for display in rankings.
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        prompt: "a chair shaped like an avocado",
        num_inference_steps: 32,
        num_outputs: 1,
        extension: "ply",
        model: "openai/shap-e"
    })
});
```
Replace `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `YOUR_SITE_URL`, and `YOUR_SITE_NAME` with your actual credentials and information.

## Step 3: Handle the Response

Once you've made the request, you'll want to handle the response to ensure that your application can process and display the results effectively.

```typescript Add Response Handling
fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/objects/generations", {
  // ... (rest of the fetch request)
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('Generated Image:', data);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

An example of a sample response
```typescript Example Response Type
    //Each generation will contain either a base64 string or a hosted url, or both.
    interface MediaOutput {
    uri?: string; //base64 string
    url?: string; //hosted url
    }

    interface MediaResponse {
    generations: MediaOutput[];
    }
```

## Step 4: Handle Errors

You can log an errors you may encounter and use the codes to help debug what the problem might be.

You can adjust your code for handling errors by using the following code

```typescript Error Handling code
  const request = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/...")
  console.log(request.status) // Will be an error code unless the model started processing your request
  const response = await request.json()
  console.error(response.error?.status) // Will be an error code
  console.error(response.error?.message)
```

**Error Codes**

| Error Code | Description                                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 400        | Bad Request (invalid or missing params, CORS)           |
| 401        | Invalid credentials (OAuth session expired, disabled/invalid API key) |
| 402        | Out of credits                                          |
| 403        | Your chosen model requires moderation and your input was flagged |
| 408        | Your request timed out                                  |
| 429        | You are being rate limited                              |
| 502        | Your chosen model is down or we received an invalid response from it |

## Step 1: Install Requests Library

Ensure you have the `requests` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Request

You'll be making a POST request to the OpenRouter API using Python's `requests` library. Here's the basic structure wrapped in a function for easy reuse:

```python Use Model On OpenRouter
import requests
import json

def send_request():
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
    YOUR_SITE_URL = "your_site_url_here"
    YOUR_APP_NAME = "your_app_name_here"

    response = requests.post(
        url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/objects/generations",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {OPENROUTER_API_KEY}",
            "HTTP-Referer": YOUR_SITE_URL,  # Optional, for openrouter.ai rankings.
            "X-Title": YOUR_APP_NAME,  # Optional, shows in rankings on openrouter.ai.
        },
        data=json.dumps({
            "prompt": "a chair shaped like an avocado",
            "num_inference_steps": 32,
            "num_outputs": 1,
            "extension": "ply",
            "model": "openai/shap-e"
        })
    )
    return response
```
Replace `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `YOUR_SITE_URL`, and `YOUR_SITE_NAME` with your actual credentials and information.

## Step 3: Handle the Response

Process the response from the API to handle the data effectively in your application.

```python Add Response Handling
  response = send_request()
  if response.status_code == 200:
      data = response.json()
      print('Generated Image:', data)
  else:
      print('Error:', response.status_code)
```

An example of a sample response
```typescript Example Response Type
//Each generation will contain either a base64 string or a hosted url, or both.
interface MediaOutput {
uri?: string; //base64 string
url?: string; //hosted url
}

interface MediaResponse {
generations: MediaOutput[];
}
```

## Step 4: Handle Errors

You can log any errors you may encounter and use the codes to help debug what the problem might be.

You can adjust your code for handling errors by using the following code

```typescript Error Handling code
  const request = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/...")
  console.log(request.status) // Will be an error code unless the model started processing your request
  const response = await request.json()
  console.error(response.error?.status) // Will be an error code
  console.error(response.error?.message)
```

<Tab title="curl">
## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have `cURL` installed in your command-line environment. It's typically pre-installed on many Unix-like operating systems. If not, you can download and install it from [the cURL website](https://curl.haxx.se/).

## Step 2: Set Up Your cURL Request

You'll be making a POST request to the OpenRouter API using cURL. Here's the command you'll use:

```bash
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/objects/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "a chair shaped like an avocado",
    "num_inference_steps": 32,
    "num_outputs": 1,
    "extension": "ply",
    "model": "openai/shap-e"
  }'
```

In this command, replace `$OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Step 3: Execute the Request

Run the above command in your terminal. Ensure you have replaced `$OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Step 4: Understand the Response

Upon successful execution, the OpenRouter API will return a JSON response. You can process this response as per your requirement in your application or script.

## Step 5: Handle Errors

If there's an error in your request or with the API, cURL will display an error message. Refer to the below error codes for troubleshooting:
