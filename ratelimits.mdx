## Rate Limits and Credits Remaining

### Checking Rate Limits and Credits

To check the rate limit or credits left on an API key, make a `GET` request to the following endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/key", {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY'
  },
});
```

```python Python
import requests

OPENROUTER_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key

response = requests.get(
    "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/key",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {OPENROUTER_API_KEY}"}
)

# To print the response
print(response.json())
```

```curl Curl
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/key \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

Be sure to replace `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your key. With a valid API key, the response will follow this structure:

```typescript Response
type Key = {
  data: {
    label: string,
    usage: number, // Number of credits used
    limit: number | null, // Credit limit for the key, null if unlimited
    is_free_tier: boolean, // Indicates if the user has paid for credits
    rate_limit: {
      requests: number, // Number of requests allowed...
      interval: string // ...in this interval, e.g., "10s"
    }
  }
}
```

## Understanding Rate Limits

Rate limits depend on the number of credits remaining on your key or account. Essentially, your rate limit equals your credits per second, subject to a current surge limit of 200. The formula is:

```typescript formula
requests_per_10_seconds = 10 * Math.min(1 + Math.floor(Math.max(credits, 0)), 200)
```

For example:

**Example 1:** With 9.9 credits, you can make 100 requests every 10 seconds.

**Example 2:** With -0.1 credits, you're limited to 10 requests every 10 seconds (possible 402 errors).

Exceptions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Surge Limit">
    A rate limit of 200 requests per second applies to all users, serving as a safeguard against denial-of-service attacks. For higher limits, contact our support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Free Models">
    Users of free models have a limit of 50 requests per second.  
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Token Limits

### Understanding Token Limits

Users with limited credits may not be able to make certain requests. To understand the maximum tokens you can generate and the maximum tokens allowed in a prompt, use this `GET` request:

```typescript Token Limits
fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models", {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY'
  },
});
```

Each model's response includes a `per_request_limits` property:

```typescript Per Request Limit

type Model = {
  id: string,
  pricing: {
    prompt: number,
    completion: number
  },
  context_length: number,
  per_request_limits: {
    prompt_tokens: number,
    completion_tokens: number
  }
}
```
