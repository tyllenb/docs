Model usage can be paid by users, developers, or both, and may shift in [availability](https://openrouter.ai/terms#services). You can also fetch models, prices, and limits via [API](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models). 

<Note>Token counting is approximate. OpenRouter does not store prompts or completions.</Note>

If you'd like to add an open source model directly to OpenRouter, view the [Runner](/runner) page
